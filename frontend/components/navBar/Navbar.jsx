AI is helping insurers make sense of vast amounts of data faster and in real-time, from unstructured content like police reports and dashboard camera footage to written descriptions and vehicle telemetry. Through capabilities like natural language processing, image classification, and vector embedding, AI enables insurers to tame the flood of claim-related data, generate accurate catastrophe impact assessments, expedite claim routing with richer metadata, avoid litigation through better analysis, and prevent losses altogether through predictive risk assessment.",
